# Credit Discovery

Systematically discovers startup credit programs and identifies the most valuable opportunities based on your company profile.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill should be used when:
- Launching a new startup and seeking to minimize infrastructure costs
- Raising a funding round that creates eligibility for new credit programs
- Joining an accelerator that unlocks access to partner credits
- Planning infrastructure budgets and seeking ways to offset costs
- Looking for methods to extend operational runway

## Core Principle

Early-stage startups face significant resource constraints. Major technology companies offer hundreds of thousands of dollars in credits to qualifying startups. Success requires knowing which programs exist, understanding what they offer, and identifying how to stack them for maximum value.

## How to Use This Skill

### Step 1: Profile Your Startup

Gather this information about the company before beginning:

**Company Basics:**
- Incorporation date (age of company)
- Current funding stage (pre-seed, seed, Series A, etc.)
- Total funding raised to date
- Revenue (if any)
- Team size

**Affiliations:**
- Accelerator/incubator membership (Y Combinator, Techstars, etc.)
- VC backing (which firms?)
- University affiliations
- Industry partnerships

**Technical Profile:**
- Primary tech stack
- Cloud infrastructure needs
- Expected monthly burn on infrastructure
- SaaS tools currently using

### Step 2: Identify Eligible Programs

Reference the comprehensive program database to find all programs you qualify for.

**Major Categories:**

**Cloud Infrastructure** (Biggest value):
- Google Cloud for Startups: Up to $350,000
- AWS Activate: Up to $100,000  
- Microsoft for Startups: Up to $150,000
- Cloudflare for Startups: Up to $250,000

**SaaS & Developer Tools**:
- Notion, Linear, Retool, Datadog, etc.
- Typically $10k-$100k in credits
- 50+ programs available

**AI & ML Platforms**:
- OpenAI, Anthropic, ElevenLabs
- Compute credits for model training/inference

### Step 3: Prioritize by Value & Likelihood

Create a prioritized list of programs based on:

1. **Credit Amount**: Larger programs first
2. **Likelihood of Acceptance**: Match your profile to requirements
3. **Immediate Need**: Programs for tools you're already using
4. **Stacking Potential**: Programs that unlock access to other programs

**Example Priority List:**

| Rank | Program | Typical Amount | Likelihood | Reason |
|------|---------|----------------|------------|--------|
| 1 | Google Cloud | $2k-$25k | Medium-High | Most startups qualify for standard tier |
| 2 | AWS Activate | $1k-$5k | Medium | Self-service tier available |
| 3 | Microsoft | Varies | Medium | B2B SaaS companies often qualify |
| 4 | Notion | Free tier | High | Standard startup program |
| 5 | Linear | Free tier | High | Standard startup program |

### Step 4: Identify Stacking Opportunities

Some programs unlock access to others. The most powerful chain:

**The GCP → NVIDIA → GCP Ecosystem Chain:**
1. Apply to Google Cloud for Startups ($200k)
2. Use GCP credits to join NVIDIA Inception
3. NVIDIA provides additional $120k GCP credits
4. Total: $320k+ in GCP credits

**Other Stacking Strategies:**
- Active cloud usage → Ecosystem programs (like NVIDIA → GCP)
- Using specific tools → Their startup programs
- Company growth → Tier upgrades at cloud providers

## Example Usage

**Scenario:** Early-stage bootstrapped SaaS startup

**Step 1: Profile**
- Incorporated recently
- Building B2B SaaS product
- Bootstrapped (no funding raised)
- Need cloud infrastructure and development tools

**Step 2: Discover Eligible Programs**
- Review program database for matches
- Identify programs that don't require funding or accelerator affiliation

**Step 3: Prioritized List (General Programs)**
1. **Google Cloud for Startups**: Standard tier ($2k) or ecosystem tier with NVIDIA ($25k)
2. **AWS Activate**: Self-service tier available
3. **Microsoft for Startups**: Various tiers based on company profile
4. **SaaS Tools**: Notion, Linear, Retool (often have startup programs)

**Step 4: Stacking Strategy Example**
- Apply to Google Cloud standard tier ($2k)
- If using cloud actively, apply to NVIDIA Inception program
- NVIDIA acceptance unlocks GCP ecosystem tier (up to $25k additional)
- Apply to complementary SaaS tools based on what you're using

**Result**: Credits help reduce monthly cash burn on infrastructure and tools

## Program Database Structure

The complete database (see `references/program-database.md`) includes:

| Program | Credit Amount | Key Requirements | Application Link |
|---------|---------------|------------------|------------------|
| Google Cloud | Up to $350k | Pre-seed to Series A, <10yrs | [Link] |
| AWS Activate | Up to $100k | Affiliated with partner | [Link] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

*50+ programs cataloged with:*
- Exact credit amounts
- Eligibility requirements
- Application URLs
- Approval timelines
- Renewal options

## Stacking Strategies in Detail

### Strategy 1: The Ecosystem Play
Focus on one primary cloud provider, then stack partner programs on top.

**Example**: Google Cloud Ecosystem
- Base: GCP for Startups ($200k)
- Add: NVIDIA via GCP ($120k GCP)
- Add: MongoDB via GCP (Credits)
- Total: $320k+ unified platform

### Strategy 2: The Multi-Cloud Approach
Diversify across providers for redundancy and maximum total credits.

**Example**: Multi-Cloud
- GCP: $200k
- AWS: $100k
- Azure: $150k
- Total: $450k across platforms

### Strategy 3: The SaaS Stack
Focus on SaaS tools that directly reduce operational costs.

**Example**: Operational Stack
- Notion: $500/mo saved
- Retool: $5k credits
- Datadog: $100k credits
- HubSpot: 90% discount
- Total: Significant monthly burn reduction

## Common Eligibility Patterns

**Most Common Requirements:**
- Company age: <2 years (sometimes <5 or <10)
- Funding: Pre-seed to Series A, typically <$10M raised
- Affiliation: Accelerator, VC, or university partnership
- Profile: Professional website, pitch deck

**Note:** If you're part of an accelerator or have VC backing, those organizations typically provide direct links to partner credit programs. These skills are most valuable for bootstrapped founders navigating programs independently.

## Reference Resources

See `references/` for:
- **program-database.md**: Complete list of programs with details, eligibility criteria, and stacking strategies

## Prerequisites

Complete these prerequisites before starting discovery:
- [ ] Ensure professional company website is live
- [ ] Prepare pitch deck (required for most programs)
- [ ] Have incorporation documents ready
- [ ] Ensure cap table and funding information is accessible

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Applying blindly** - Verify eligibility requirements before applying
❌ **Ignoring stacking** - Miss opportunities where some programs unlock access to others
❌ **Waiting too long** - Some programs impose company age limits (<1yr, <2yrs)
❌ **Incomplete applications** - Missing pitch deck or website typically results in automatic rejection
❌ **Not tracking renewals** - Overlook opportunities as many programs offer extensions
