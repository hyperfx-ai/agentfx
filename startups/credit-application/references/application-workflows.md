    *   A professional company website and domain.
    *   A Google account associated with your company domain.
    *   A brief description of your startup and how you plan to use Google Cloud.
    *   (For Scale Tier) Proof of funding from an institutional investor (e.g., SAFE agreement, term sheet).

2.  **Navigate to the Application Page**: Go to the [Google Cloud for Startups](https://cloud.google.com/startup/apply) application page.

3.  **Complete the Application Form**: Fill out the form with accurate information about your startup. Be clear and concise in your description. If you have a referral code from a partner, be sure to use it.

4.  **Submit and Wait for Review**: After submitting, your application will be reviewed by the Google Cloud team. This can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks.

5.  **Follow Up (If Necessary)**: If you don't hear back within a reasonable timeframe, you can try to follow up through the Google Cloud support channels or by reaching out to a Google for Startups representative if you have a contact.

## Workflow 2: Applying for AWS Activate

**Objective**: Secure AWS credits, often through a partner program.

**Steps**:

1.  **Find an AWS Activate Partner**: The easiest way to get AWS Activate credits is through a partner. This can be a VC, accelerator, incubator, or even a SaaS company you are using. Check the websites of your investors and key vendors to see if they are Activate partners.

2.  **Get a Referral Link**: Once you find a partner, they will provide you with a unique referral link or organization ID to use in your application.

3.  **Complete the AWS Activate Application**: Use the referral link to access the application. You will need to provide information about your startup, your AWS account ID, and your business plan.

4.  **Submit and Wait for Approval**: AWS typically reviews applications within a few weeks. Approval is highly likely when applying through a reputable partner.

## Workflow 3: Applying for Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub

## Generic Workflow for SaaS Startup Programs

**Objective**: Secure credits and discounts for various SaaS tools.

**Steps**:

1.  **Identify Target Programs**: Use the program database to identify SaaS tools that are relevant to your startup.

2.  **Check Eligibility**: Carefully review the eligibility requirements for each program. Most require you to be early-stage (less than 2 years old, less than $5M in funding).

3.  **Look for Partner Portals**: Many SaaS companies distribute their startup credits through partners like Stripe Atlas, AWS Activate, or major VCs. Check these portals first, as applying through them is often easier than applying directly.

4.  **Apply Directly**: If no partner portal is available, apply directly through the company's startup program page. Be prepared to provide:
    *   Your company website.
    *   A link to your Crunchbase or PitchBook profile (if you have one).
    *   A brief description of your company.
    *   Proof of incorporation or funding.

5.  **Track Your Applications**: Keep a spreadsheet of the programs you have applied to, the date of application, and the outcome. This will help you stay organized and follow up as needed.
