# Credit Application

Guides operators through the application process for startup credit programs with step-by-step workflows and document management.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill should be used when:
- Ready to apply for specific credit programs after discovery phase
- Preparing application materials and documentation
- Tracking multiple applications across different programs simultaneously
- Following up on pending applications to ensure timely responses
- Managing awarded credits and monitoring renewal dates

## Core Principle

Most startup credit programs require similar documentation but have different application processes. This skill provides repeatable workflows to efficiently apply to multiple programs while ensuring no required elements are missed.

## How to Use This Skill

### Step 1: Pre-Application Verification

Complete this checklist before applying to any program:

#### Company Materials (Required for 90%+ of programs)
- [ ] **Company Website**: Professional site clearly explaining what you do
- [ ] **Pitch Deck**: 10-15 slides covering problem, solution, traction, team
- [ ] **Incorporation Docs**: Certificate of incorporation with date
- [ ] **Cap Table**: Current ownership structure (for later-stage programs)

#### Company Information
- [ ] Legal company name
- [ ] Incorporation date
- [ ] Incorporation location
- [ ] Company website URL
- [ ] Product description (2-3 sentences)
- [ ] Industry/vertical
- [ ] Team size
- [ ] Funding stage (pre-seed, seed, Series A, etc.)
- [ ] Total funding raised
- [ ] Revenue (if any)

#### Contact Information
- [ ] Primary contact name & title
- [ ] Contact email
- [ ] Company address
- [ ] Phone number (for some programs)

#### Affiliations
- [ ] Accelerator/incubator name (if applicable)
- [ ] VC investors (if applicable)
- [ ] University affiliations (if applicable)
- [ ] Partner codes (if you have them)

### Step 2: Application Workflows by Provider

Follow the specific workflow for each program type:

#### Workflow A: Major Cloud Providers (GCP, AWS, Azure)

**For: Google Cloud for Startups**

1. **Navigate** to [cloud.google.com/startup/apply](https://cloud.google.com/startup/apply)
2. **Select pathway**:
   - Option 1: Through accelerator/partner (if applicable)
   - Option 2: Direct application
3. **Fill application form**:
   - Company details (name, website, incorporation date)
   - Product description
   - Expected cloud spend
   - Upload pitch deck
4. **Submit** and note application ID
5. **Follow up**: Expect response in 7-14 days
6. **If approved**: Activate credits in GCP console within 30 days

**For: AWS Activate**

1. **Check eligibility**:
   - Option A: Through accelerator (automatic, up to $100k)
   - Option B: Through VC (requires VC email)
   - Option C: Self-service ($1k-$5k, limited)
2. **Get referral** (if Option A or B):
   - Contact your accelerator/VC for unique application link
3. **Apply through link**:
   - Company information
   - AWS account ID (create if don't have)
   - Business email (must match company domain)
4. **Submit**
5. **Receive**: Credits typically activated within 24-48 hours

**For: Microsoft for Startups**

1. **Navigate** to [foundershub.startups.microsoft.com](https://foundershub.startups.microsoft.com/)
2. **Create Founders Hub account**
3. **Complete profile**:
   - Company details
   - Product information
   - Revenue (<$10M requirement)
   - Upload deck (for $150k tier)
4. **Submit application**
5. **If approved**: Create Azure account and link credits

#### Workflow B: SaaS Tools (Notion, Linear, Retool, etc.)

**General SaaS Application Pattern:**

1. **Find startup page**: Usually `/startups` or `/early-stage` URL path
2. **Check requirements**: Most require:
   - Company age (<2 years typical)
   - Funding amount (<$5M typical)
   - Professional website
3. **Fill short form**:
   - Company name & website
   - Brief description
   - Funding stage
   - How you'll use the tool
4. **Submit**
5. **Fast response**: Most approve/reject within 24-72 hours

**Example: Notion for Startups**

1. Go to [notion.so/startups](https://www.notion.so/startups)
2. Click "Apply now"
3. Fill form (2 minutes):
   - Company name
   - Website
   - How you'll use Notion
   - Team size
4. Submit
5. Receive approval email with promo code
6. Apply code to billing

#### Workflow C: AI/ML Credits (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

**Note:** Many AI platform credit programs are primarily available through accelerators or VC partnerships. Check if your company qualifies through any existing affiliations. For general startup programs, check each platform's startup/developer program pages directly.

### Step 3: Application Tracking System

Track all applications in a spreadsheet or tool:

| Program | Amount | Date Applied | Status | Approval Date | Expiration | Notes |
|---------|--------|--------------|--------|---------------|------------|-------|
| GCP | $200k | 2024-01-15 | Approved | 2024-01-22 | 2025-01-22 | Activated |
| AWS | $100k | 2024-01-15 | Approved | 2024-01-16 | 2026-01-16 | Via YC |
| Notion | 6mo | 2024-01-18 | Approved | 2024-01-19 | 2024-07-19 | Auto-renew? |
| Retool | $60k | 2024-01-20 | Pending | - | - | Follow up 1/27 |

**Track these fields:**
- **Program name**: Which credit program
- **Credit amount**: Value of credits
- **Date applied**: When you submitted
- **Status**: Pending, Approved, Rejected, Activated
- **Approval date**: When approved
- **Expiration date**: When credits expire
- **Renewal eligible**: Can you reapply?
- **Notes**: Any special conditions

### Step 4: Follow-Up Process

When no response has been received within expected timeframes:

**Timeline:**
- **Cloud providers**: Follow up after 14 days
- **SaaS tools**: Follow up after 7 days
- **AI platforms**: Follow up after 10 days

**How to follow up:**
1. Reply to confirmation email (if you got one)
2. Reference your application ID
3. Brief, professional inquiry about status
4. Restate your eligibility (accelerator, funding, etc.)

**Template:**
```
Subject: Following up on [Company Name] application for [Program Name]

Hi [Program] Team,

I submitted an application for [Program Name] on [Date] (Application ID: [ID if available]).

We're a [stage] startup in [industry], backed by [affiliations]. We're excited about the opportunity to use [Program] for [use case].

Could you provide an update on the status of our application?

Thank you,
[Name]
[Title]
[Company]
```

### Step 5: Credit Activation & Management

Once approved:

1. **Activate immediately**: Most credits expire if not activated within 30-90 days
2. **Set up billing alerts**: Know when you're approaching credit limits
3. **Track usage**: Monitor how quickly you're burning through credits
4. **Calendar renewals**: Set reminders 30 days before expiration
5. **Apply for extensions**: Some programs offer additional credits after first batch

## Example Usage

**Scenario:** Bootstrapped SaaS startup applying to startup credit programs

**Morning: Preparation (1 hour)**
- Gather all materials from verification checklist
- Create tracking spreadsheet
- Prepare one-paragraph company description

**Application Session (2-3 hours)**

**Step 1 - Google Cloud for Startups**
- Navigate to application portal
- Fill form (15-20 minutes)
- Include company details and use case
- Upload pitch deck if you have one
- Submit
- Log in tracking sheet: "Pending"

**Step 2 - AWS Activate**
- Apply through self-service tier or partner pathway if applicable
- Fill form (10-15 minutes)
- Submit with AWS account ID
- Log in tracking sheet: "Pending"

**Step 3 - SaaS Tools**
- Apply to tools you're actively using (Notion, Linear, etc.)
- Each typically takes 5-10 minutes
- Most have simple forms on their /startups pages
- Log each in tracking sheet

**Results:**
Application approval times vary by program (typically 1-14 days). Track status and follow up as needed.

**Time Invested**: 2-4 hours total
**Impact**: Reduces monthly cash burn on infrastructure and tools

## Common Application Mistakes

❌ **Using personal email** - Applications require company domain email addresses
❌ **Incomplete pitch deck** - Ensure inclusion of team, traction, and problem slides
❌ **Vague product description** - Provide specific details about the product being built
❌ **Wrong funding stage** - Report accurate funding stage; some programs have eligibility caps
❌ **Missing accelerator connection** - Always mention applicable accelerator affiliations
❌ **Not activating credits** - Credits often expire after 30-90 days if left unused

## Application Tips

✅ **Apply early** - Many programs favor younger companies in their evaluation
✅ **Be specific** - Detailed use cases significantly improve approval odds
✅ **Leverage affiliations** - YC, Techstars, and VC backing provide substantial advantages
✅ **Apply to multiple** - Diversify applications across multiple programs
✅ **Follow up** - Polite follow-ups help surface applications that may have been overlooked
✅ **Track everything** - Maintain systematic tracking to avoid losing track of applications
