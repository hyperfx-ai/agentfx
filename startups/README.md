## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using these skills, ensure you have:

1. **Professional Website**: Clear explanation of what your company does
2. **Pitch Deck**: 10-15 slides (problem, solution, traction, team)
3. **Company Info Ready**:
   - Incorporation date
   - Funding stage and amount
   - Team size
   - Accelerator/VC affiliations (if any)

### Recommended Workflow

**Step 1: Profile Your Startup** (15 minutes)
- Gather company information
- List all affiliations (accelerators, VCs, universities)
- Identify immediate infrastructure needs

**Step 2: Run Credit Discovery** (30 minutes)
- Use credit-discovery skill to identify eligible programs
- Review program database for matches
- Prioritize by value and likelihood
- Identify stacking opportunities

**Step 3: Prepare Materials** (1-2 hours)
- Complete verification checklist
- Ensure website is professional
- Update pitch deck if needed
- Gather incorporation documents

**Step 4: Application Sprint** (3-4 hours)
- Use credit-application skill workflows
- Apply to top 10-15 programs in one session
- Set up tracking spreadsheet
- Calendar follow-ups

**Step 5: Activate & Manage**
- Activate credits immediately upon approval
- Set billing alerts
- Track usage and expiration dates
- Apply for renewals when eligible

## Example Workflow

**Typical Startup Profile:**
- Recently incorporated (less than 1 year old)
- Building a SaaS product
- Bootstrapped (no funding raised yet)
- 2-3 co-founders
- Need to minimize infrastructure costs

**Discovery Phase:**
Use credit-discovery skill to identify eligible programs

**Common Programs for Bootstrapped Startups:**
- Google Cloud for Startups (standard tier: $2k, ecosystem tier with NVIDIA accelerator: up to $25k)
- AWS Activate (self-service tier available)
- Microsoft for Startups (various tiers based on company profile)
- SaaS tools (Notion, Linear, Retool, etc. typically offer free tiers or startup credits)

**Application Process:**
Use credit-application workflows to systematically apply to relevant programs

**Impact:**
Credits can significantly extend runway by covering infrastructure and software costs that would otherwise require cash burn

## Credit Stacking Strategies

### Strategy 1: The Ecosystem Stack
Focus on one cloud provider and stack partner programs on top.

**Example:**
- Base: GCP for Startups ($200k)
- Stack: NVIDIA Inception via GCP (+$120k GCP credits)
- Result: $320k+ on one platform

### Strategy 2: Multi-Cloud Diversification
Spread across providers for redundancy and maximum credits.

**Example:**
- GCP: $200k
- AWS: $100k  
- Azure: $150k
- Result: $450k across three platforms

### Strategy 3: The SaaS Stack
Minimize operational burn with SaaS tool credits.

**Example:**
- Retool: $60k
- Datadog: $100k
- HubSpot: 90% discount
- Notion + Linear + Figma: Free tiers
- Result: Significant monthly burn reduction

## Timing Matters

**Best Time to Apply:**

✅ **Immediately after:**
- Raising a funding round
- Joining an accelerator
- Getting VC backing
- Incorporating (many programs favor <1yr companies)

⚠️ **Be aware:**
- Some programs have age limits (<2 years is common)
- Accelerator programs often have batch-specific deadlines
- Credit amounts can decrease as company matures

## Common Eligibility Patterns

**Almost Always Required:**
- Professional website
- Valid business email (not @gmail.com)
- Incorporation documents

**Often Required:**
- Pitch deck (especially for larger amounts)
- Affiliation (accelerator, VC, university)
- Revenue limits (typically <$10M)
- Age limits (typically <2 or <5 years)

**Note on Accelerators:**
If you're part of an accelerator program (Y Combinator, Techstars, etc.), they typically provide credit program links directly to participants. These skills are most useful for bootstrapped founders without accelerator access.

## Program Categories

**Highest Value** (apply first):
- Cloud infrastructure (GCP, AWS, Azure)
- Hosting platforms (Vercel, Cloudflare)

**Medium Value** (great for extending runway):
- Developer tools (Datadog, Sentry)
- Internal tools (Retool, Notion, Linear)
- AI/ML platforms (OpenAI, Anthropic)

**Lower Value but Useful**:
- Communication tools (Slack, Zoom)
- Design tools (Figma, Canva)
- Productivity tools (Asana, Airtable)

## Renewal & Extensions

Many programs offer:
- **Renewals**: Reapply after credits expire
- **Extensions**: Request more if you're growing fast
- **Graduation programs**: Access to paid tier discounts

**Tips:**
- Calendar renewal dates
- Document your growth when requesting extensions
- Maintain relationship with program managers

## ROI Calculation

**Time Investment:**
- Discovery: 30-60 minutes
- Preparation: 1-2 hours
- Applications: 3-4 hours
- **Total: ~6 hours**

**Value Secured:**
- Typical outcome: $500k-$1.2M in credits
- **ROI: $83k-$200k per hour invested**

This is likely the highest-ROI activity any early-stage startup can do.

## Tips for Success

✅ **Do apply early** - Don't wait until you "need" credits
✅ **Do leverage affiliations** - YC, VCs, universities unlock programs
✅ **Do apply to many** - Maximize your chances
✅ **Do track everything** - Easy to lose track of what you applied for
✅ **Do activate immediately** - Credits often expire if not used

❌ **Don't use personal emails** - Must use company domain
❌ **Don't be vague** - Specific use cases get approved more
❌ **Don't wait until desperate** - Some programs favor younger companies
❌ **Don't forget to follow up** - Applications can get lost
❌ **Don't ignore smaller programs** - $10k here, $25k there adds up
