## Stacking Strategies

Maximizing startup credits involves more than just applying to individual programs. The key is to understand how programs can be "stacked"—where acceptance into one program unlocks eligibility for another, often more valuable, program.

### The GCP → NVIDIA → GCP Ecosystem Chain

This is the most powerful and well-known stacking strategy, potentially yielding over $120,000 in Google Cloud credits.

1.  **Apply to Google Cloud for Startups**: First, get accepted into the basic Google Cloud for Startups program. The "Start" tier is for unfunded companies and provides up to $2,000 in credits. The "Scale" tier is for funded companies and provides up to $100,000.

2.  **Apply to NVIDIA Inception**: Once you have your Google Cloud credits, apply to the NVIDIA Inception program. This program is designed to help startups working with AI and deep learning. Acceptance is relatively straightforward, especially if you can demonstrate you are using or plan to use NVIDIA GPUs on Google Cloud.

3.  **Unlock the GCP Ecosystem Tier**: After being accepted into NVIDIA Inception, you become eligible for the Google Cloud Ecosystem tier. This tier is specifically for startups that are part of a partner program (like NVIDIA Inception). This tier provides up to an additional $20,000 in Google Cloud credits.

**Result**: By following this chain, you can turn a basic $2,000 credit package into a $122,000+ package.

### Other Stacking Opportunities

-   **AWS Activate Partners**: Many SaaS companies (like HubSpot, Segment, and others) are AWS Activate partners. By getting accepted into their startup programs, you often unlock eligibility for AWS Activate credits, even if you don't have a traditional VC backer.

-   **Stripe Atlas Partner Perks**: Incorporating with Stripe Atlas unlocks a wide range of partner perks, including credits for AWS, DigitalOcean, and many SaaS tools. This is a great way to get a broad set of credits with a single application.

-   **Accelerator Programs**: Joining a reputable accelerator (like Y Combinator, Techstars, etc.) is the ultimate stacking strategy. These programs typically provide a large bundle of credits across all major cloud providers and dozens of SaaS tools as part of their standard deal.

## Next Steps

-   Create detailed application workflows for each major program.
-   Develop a verification checklist of required documents (incorporation documents, pitch deck, etc.).
-   Build the final skill set structure with a README and SKILL.md file.
