# Startup Credits Navigator

Use this skill to help operators navigate the complex landscape of startup credits. Systematically discover, apply for, and manage free credits and resources, potentially saving hundreds of thousands of dollars in infrastructure and software costs.

## Prerequisites

Before applying for startup credit programs, ensure you have:

- **A professional website** that clearly describes what your company does
- **A pitch deck** for most programs, especially those offering larger credit packages

These are essential requirements for the majority of startup credit applications.

## Core Philosophy

Early-stage startups are often resource-constrained. This skill provides the knowledge base and strategic framework to help operators leverage the vast ecosystem of startup programs offered by major technology companies. Be proactive and strategic in seeking out and applying for these valuable resources.

## Core Workflow

When using this skill, assist operators by:

1.  **Discover**: Identify all relevant startup credit programs based on the operator's company profile.
2.  **Prioritize**: Rank programs based on value and likelihood of acceptance.
3.  **Apply**: Guide the operator through the application process for each program.
4.  **Track**: Help manage the status of applications and the usage of awarded credits.

## Reference Resources

This skill includes several resources detailed in the `references/` directory:

-   **[references/program-database.md](references/program-database.md)**: A comprehensive database of over 50 startup credit programs, including credit amounts, eligibility requirements, and application links.
-   **[references/application-workflows.md](references/application-workflows.md)**: Step-by-step guides for applying to the major cloud and SaaS credit programs.
-   **[references/verification-checklist.md](references/verification-checklist.md)**: A checklist of all the documents and information needed before applying.

## Usage

When working with an operator:

1.  **Review the Checklist**: Guide the operator through `verification-checklist.md` to gather all necessary company information and ensure they have a pitch deck ready.
2.  **Identify Target Programs**: Use `program-database.md` to identify programs that are the best fit for the operator's startup.
3.  **Follow the Workflows**: Reference `application-workflows.md` to guide the operator through the application process for target programs.
4.  **Track Progress**: Help the operator track programs applied to, application statuses, and credits received.
