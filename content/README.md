# Content Skills

Skills for creating high-quality content across different formats and platforms.

## Available Skills

### clear-content

Generates content that prioritizes clarity and simplicity over complexity. Use when creating blog posts, social media content, or marketing copy that needs to be direct, factually accurate, and accessible without sacrificing intelligence.

**Key principles:**
- Intelligence = Simplicity
- Simple words over jargon
- Direct sentences over complicated constructions
- Specific examples over vague claims
- Clarity over cleverness

**Use cases:**
- Blog posts and articles
- Twitter threads
- LinkedIn posts
- Marketing copy
- Technical documentation
- Product announcements

**What you get:**
- Frameworks for long-form (blog) and short-form (social) content
- Before/after examples showing transformations
- Word substitution guides (jargon → simple)
- Reusable sentence patterns
- Quality checklists

**Inspired by:** The writing style of companies like OpenAI, Vercel, Stripe—where clarity and simplicity signal intelligence, not the absence of it.

## Philosophy

Content generation shouldn't sound like AI wrote it. It shouldn't use jargon, overcomplicate ideas, or hide behind business speak.

Good content:
- States the point immediately
- Uses simple words
- Provides specific examples
- Respects the reader's time
- Sounds like a smart human

These skills help generate content that meets that bar.

## When to Use These Skills

Use content skills when:
- AI-generated content sounds too formal or complicated

- Technical concepts need explanation without jargon
- Social media content needs to cut through noise
- Blog posts need to be accessible yet intelligent

Don't use when:
- Academic or formal writing is specifically required

- Industry jargon is expected by the audience
- Legal or compliance language is necessary
