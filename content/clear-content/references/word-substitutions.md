# Simple Word Substitutions

A reference guide for replacing complex or jargon-heavy words with clear, simple alternatives.

## Core Principle

If a simpler word exists, use it.

"Use" beats "utilize" every time. Not because your readers are dumb—because your readers are busy.

## Context-Dependent Replacements

Some words are fine in technical contexts but should be simplified for general audiences:

### Technical Audience:
"We implemented Redis caching to reduce latency."
(This is fine—they know what Redis is)

### General Audience:
"We made the app 10x faster using caching."
(Skip the technical details)

---

## When NOT to Simplify

Keep technical terms when:

1. **They're industry standard and audience-appropriate**
   - "API" is fine for developers
   - "SQL" is fine for data people
   - "React" is fine for frontend devs

2. **Simplifying would lose precision**
   - "Asynchronous" vs "happens at different times" (first is clearer to devs)
   - "Deprecated" vs "old" (deprecated has specific meaning)

3. **The term is shorter and clearer**
   - "Git" vs "version control system" (Git is simpler)
   - "RAM" vs "random access memory" (RAM is clearer)

## Practice Exercise

Transform this paragraph:

**Before:**
"Our organization is seeking to leverage cutting-edge technologies to optimize operational efficiencies and facilitate enhanced collaboration across distributed teams, thereby enabling stakeholders to maximize productivity and drive sustainable growth trajectories."

**After:**
"We use new tools to help remote teams work better together and get more done."

## Quick Reference Card

Print this out and keep it visible while writing:

**Simple Word First:**
- Use → not utilize
- Help → not facilitate
- Start → not commence
- Now → not at this point in time
- Because → not due to the fact that

**Cut Completely:**
- Basically
- Essentially
- At the end of the day
- It's important to note
- For all intents and purposes

**Be Specific:**
- "3x faster" → not "much faster"
- "5 minutes" → not "quick"
- "$50k saved" → not "significant savings"
