# Reusable Sentence Patterns for Clear Writing

Templates and structures for consistently clear, direct communication.

## Opening Patterns

### Pattern 1: Direct Statement
**Format:** `[Action/Fact]. Here's why.`

**Examples:**
- "We built a new tool. Here's why."
- "AI changes everything. Here's how."
- "Most companies fail at X. Here's why."

---

### Pattern 2: Contrarian Hook
**Format:** `Most people think X. Actually, Y.`

**Examples:**
- "Most people think AI will replace writers. Actually, it replaces bad writers."
- "Most companies want more features. Actually, they need fewer."
- "Everyone says work harder. Actually, work on fewer things."

---

### Pattern 3: Problem → Solution
**Format:** `[Problem statement]. We fixed it.`

**Examples:**
- "Analytics tools are too complex. We made one that's simple."
- "Hiring takes 3 months. Our tool does it in 3 weeks."
- "Nobody reads documentation. We made docs people actually use."

---

### Pattern 4: Number Hook
**Format:** `[Number] [specific thing]. Here's what I learned.`

**Examples:**
- "We interviewed 100 customers. Here's what they said."
- "Tested 10 tools. Only 2 worked."
- "Wrote 50 blog posts. 3 got all the traffic."

---

## Explanation Patterns

### Pattern 5: Analogy
**Format:** `X is like Y, but [difference].`

**Examples:**
- "APIs are like menus, but for software."
- "Vector databases are like Google, but for meaning instead of keywords."
- "Git is like save points in a video game, but for code."

---

### Pattern 6: Three-Part Structure
**Format:** `Do X. Then Y. Finally Z.`

**Examples:**
- "Pick one feature. Build it. Ship it."
- "Write the draft. Cut 30%. Read it aloud."
- "Set the goal. Measure daily. Adjust weekly."

---

### Pattern 7: Process Breakdown
**Format:** `Here's how it works: [step 1] → [step 2] → [result]`

**Examples:**
- "Here's how it works: You write code → We test it → It deploys automatically"
- "Here's how it works: Upload file → AI analyzes → Get report in 10 seconds"
- "Here's how it works: Set criteria → We find candidates → You interview"

---

## Body Patterns

### Pattern 8: The Triple
**Format:** `There are 3 reasons: [1]. [2]. [3].`

**Examples:**
```
There are 3 reasons most startups fail:

1. Build for too long before launching
2. Ignore what customers actually want
3. Run out of money before finding product-market fit

Fix all 3 and you have a chance.
```

---

### Pattern 9: Before/After
**Format:** `Before: [bad]. After: [good]. The difference: [key insight].`

**Examples:**
```
Before: 20-page docs nobody read.
After: 2-minute video everyone watched.
The difference: Show, don't tell.
```

---

### Pattern 10: The Specific Example
**Format:** `For example: [concrete case].`

**Examples:**
- "For example: Stripe's homepage. 7 words. Clear value prop."

- "Most advice is obvious. The hard part is doing it. What are you waiting for?"

---

### Pattern 13: Echo Close
**Format:** Repeat the opening insight with slight variation.

**Examples:**
```
Opening: "AI won't replace your job."
Closing: "AI won't replace jobs. It'll replace people who don't adapt."

Opening: "Most companies overthink it."
Closing: "Stop overthinking. Start shipping."
```

---

## Transition Patterns

### Pattern 14: Simple Transitions
Use these instead of complex transitional phrases:

| Instead of... | Use... |
|---------------|--------|
| "Furthermore" | "Also" |
| "In addition to this" | "Plus" |
| "Consequently" | "So" |
| "Nevertheless" | "But" |
| "Subsequently" | "Then" |

---

```

---

### Pattern 17: The Contrast
**Format:** `X does [this]. Y does [opposite].`

- "Beginners talk about tools. Experts talk about problems."

---

## List Patterns

### Pattern 18: The Numbered List
**Format:** Clear structure with parallel construction.

**Good:**
```
3 things that work:
1. Ship fast
2. Get feedback
3. Iterate
```

**Bad:**
```
3 things:
1. You should try to ship as quickly as possible
2. Gathering comprehensive user feedback
3. Making iterative improvements based on learnings
```

---

### Pattern 19: The Bullet Breakdown
**Format:** Each bullet = complete thought, same structure.

**Good:**
```
What customers want:

```

---

## Paragraph Patterns

### Pattern 20: The Mini-Essay
**Format:** 3-5 sentences, one idea.

**Structure:**
1. Topic sentence (the point)
2. Evidence or example
3. Why it matters
4. (Optional) What to do about it

**Example:**
```
Most products have too many features. Customers use 3-5 regularly. 
The rest create confusion and slow down the product. Cut everything 
that isn't essential. Users will thank you.
```

---

### Pattern 21: The One-Liner Paragraph
**Format:** Single impactful sentence, isolated.

**Examples:**
```
That's the difference.

Simple as that.

It works.

But nobody does it.
```

---

## Social Media Patterns

99 made the same mistake.

Here's the fix:

Here's what actually works:
```

---

### Pattern 23: LinkedIn Insight
**Format:** Observation + explanation + engagement question.

**Structure:**
```
[Surprising observation]

[2-3 sentences explaining]

[Relatable example]

[Question to audience]
```

**Example:**
```
The best product managers say "no" more than "yes."

Every feature has a cost. Support burden. Complexity. Maintenance. 
Good PMs protect the product from feature bloat.

Apple does this better than anyone. The iPhone had fewer features 
than competitors. It still won.

What's the last feature request you said no to?
```

---

## Sentence Length Patterns

### Pattern 24: Rhythm Mix
Vary sentence length for readability:

**Format:** Short. Medium length with a bit more detail. Short again.

**Example:**
```
AI changes everything. (3 words)

But most companies use it wrong—they automate the wrong things and 
wonder why it doesn't help. (17 words)

Start simple. (2 words)

Pick one workflow. Automate it. Measure results. Then scale. (10 words)
```

---

### Pattern 25: The Punchy List
All short sentences in sequence.

**Example:**
```
Ship fast.
Get feedback.
Fix what breaks.
Repeat.
```

---

## Question Patterns

### Pattern 26: The Focusing Question
**Format:** Use questions to structure content.

**Examples:**
```
What's the problem? [Answer]
Why does it happen? [Answer]
How do you fix it? [Answer]
```

---

### Pattern 27: The Rhetorical Setup
**Format:** `[Question]? [Unexpected answer].`

**Examples:**
- "What's the secret to good writing? Edit more."
- "Why do startups fail? They build what nobody wants."
- "What's the best productivity tool? A deadline."

---

## Error Correction Patterns

### Pattern 28: The Myth-Buster
**Format:** `Myth: [common belief]. Reality: [truth].`

**Examples:**
```
Myth: More features = better product
Reality: Fewer features = simpler product = more users

Myth: Perfect launch required
Reality: Ship fast, fix fast

Myth: You need $1M to start
Reality: You need one customer
```

---

## Call-to-Action Patterns

### Pattern 29: The Soft CTA
**Format:** Suggest without commanding.

**Examples:**
- "Try this next time."
- "Worth testing."
- "Start here."
- "Consider this approach."

---

### Pattern 30: The Direct CTA
**Format:** Clear imperative.

**Examples:**
- "Do this today."
- "Ship it now."
- "Cut that feature."
- "Rewrite your homepage."

---

## Meta-Patterns (Patterns About Patterns)

### Universal Rules for All Patterns:

1. **One idea per sentence**
   - Bad: "AI is changing work and people need to adapt but most don't know how"
   - Good: "AI is changing work. Most people don't know how to adapt."

2. **Active voice always**
   - Bad: "The feature was built by our team"
   - Good: "We built the feature"

3. **Concrete over abstract**
   - Bad: "Facilitate enhanced productivity"
   - Good: "Work faster"

4. **Specific over vague**
   - Bad: "Significant improvement"
   - Good: "3x faster"

## Practice Exercises

**Exercise 1:** Rewrite using Pattern 2 (Contrarian Hook)
```
Sentence: "Having a lot of features is generally considered good for products."

Rewrite: "Most people think more features = better product. Actually, fewer features = simpler product = more users."
```

**Exercise 2:** Rewrite using Pattern 6 (Three-Part Structure)
```
Paragraph: "To launch a product successfully, you should begin by determining your target market, then develop the minimum viable product, and subsequently gather user feedback to iterate."

Rewrite: "Pick your customers. Build the simplest version. Ship it and iterate."
```

**Exercise 3:** Rewrite using Pattern 10 (Specific Example)
```
Statement: "Good design is important for user experience."

Rewrite: "Good design matters. For example: Stripe's homepage. 7 words. Clear value prop. Converts 30% better than their old 50-word version."
```
