# Clear Content Generation

Generates high-quality content that embodies clarity, simplicity, and directness—the hallmark of truly intelligent communication.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill should be used when:
- Creating blog posts or articles that need to be accessible yet intelligent
- Writing social media content (Twitter, LinkedIn) that cuts through noise
- Generating marketing copy that resonates without jargon
- Converting complex topics into clear, understandable content
- Avoiding the common AI pitfall of overcomplicating simple ideas

## Core Principles

**Intelligence = Simplicity**

The best writers make complex ideas simple. Poor writing makes simple ideas complex.

**The Pattern:**
1. Start with what matters
2. Use simple words
3. Keep sentences short
4. Be direct
5. Be specific (but not pedantic)
6. Be factual

**What This Is NOT:**
- Dumbing down content
- Removing nuance
- Being condescending
- Oversimplifying to the point of inaccuracy

**What This IS:**
- Respecting the reader's time
- Choosing clarity over cleverness
- Using concrete examples over abstract concepts
- Being confident enough to be simple

## How to Use This Skill

### For Blog Posts / Long-Form Content

#### Step 1: Define the Core Message

Every piece of content should have one clear point. Identify it in one sentence.

**Bad:** "We're exploring the multifaceted implications of artificial intelligence on various industry verticals."

**Good:** "AI changes how companies work."

#### Step 2: Structure with Clarity

Use this proven structure:

```
1. Opening: State the point (1-2 sentences)
2. Why it matters: One concrete reason (2-3 sentences)
3. How it works: Simple explanation with example (3-5 sentences)
4. What to do: Clear next step (1-2 sentences)
```

Keep total length: 300-800 words for blog posts.

#### Step 3: Write Using Simple Language Rules

Apply these rules to every sentence:

**Rule 1: Use Simple Words**
- "use" not "utilize"
- "help" not "facilitate"
- "show" not "demonstrate"
- "change" not "transform"
- "build" not "architect"

**Rule 2: Keep Sentences Short**
- Target: 15-20 words per sentence
- Maximum: 25 words
- Mix short (5-10 words) with medium (15-20) for rhythm

**Rule 3: Be Direct**
- "We built this" not "This was built by us"
- "This works because" not "The reason this works is"
- "Do X" not "You should consider doing X"

**Rule 4: Be Specific**
- "50% faster" not "significantly faster"
- "3 minutes" not "quick"
- "React and TypeScript" not "modern web technologies"

**Rule 5: Cut Filler**

Remove these completely:
- "In order to" → "To"
- "Due to the fact that" → "Because"
- "At this point in time" → "Now"
- "It's important to note that" → (delete)
- "Essentially" → (delete)
- "Basically" → (delete)

#### Step 4: Edit Ruthlessly

First draft → Cut 30% → Read aloud → Ship

If a sentence doesn't add information, delete it.

### For Short-Form Content (Twitter/LinkedIn)

#### Step 1: One Idea Per Post

Never try to say multiple things. Pick one.

#### Step 2: Hook + Value + End

**Format:**
```
Line 1: Hook (surprising, specific, or contrarian)
Lines 2-4: Value (explain or show)
Last line: Memorable end (insight or call to action)
```

#### Step 3: Twitter-Specific Rules (280 characters)

- First line must work standalone
- Use line breaks (no walls of text)
- Concrete > abstract
- Number = good ("3 ways" not "several ways")

**Example:**
```
AI isn't replacing writers.

It's replacing bad writers.

Good writers make complex ideas simple.
AI makes simple ideas complex.

That's the gap.
```

#### Step 4: LinkedIn-Specific Rules (1-2 paragraphs)

- Start with the insight, not context
- Use paragraphs (1-3 lines each)
- End with a question or observation
- Length: 100-200 words

**Example:**
```
Most companies explain what they do wrong.

They list features. They use jargon. They bury the point.

Good companies do the opposite. They start with the outcome. They use simple words. They show, don't tell.

The difference isn't intelligence. It's clarity.

What's one thing you've seen explained really well recently?
```

## Content Generation Framework

When given a topic, follow this framework:

### Step 1: Clarify the Core

Ask: "What's the one thing someone needs to understand?"

Write it in 10 words or less.

### Step 2: Choose Format

**Long-form:** Topic requires explanation, examples, or context  
**Short-form:** Topic is a single insight or observation

### Step 3: Generate Draft

Use the appropriate structure from above.

### Step 4: Apply Simplicity Filter

For every sentence, ask:
- Can this be shorter?
- Can this use simpler words?
- Does this add new information?

If "no" to the last question → delete.

### Step 5: Verify Facts

Check every claim:
- Is this accurate?
- Is this specific enough?
- Can this be misinterpreted?

If unsure → research or remove.

## Example Transformations

### Before (AI-typical)

```
In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, organizations are 
increasingly leveraging artificial intelligence solutions to optimize their 
operational workflows and drive meaningful business outcomes. The 
implementation of these sophisticated systems necessitates a comprehensive 
understanding of the underlying architectural paradigms and their 
implications for organizational transformation.
```

**Problems:**
- 47 words, says nothing
- Jargon: "leverage," "paradigms," "architectural"
- Vague: "meaningful outcomes," "sophisticated systems"
- No specific information

### After (Clear)

```
Companies use AI to work faster.

But most implementations fail because teams don't understand what AI 
actually does. They buy tools without knowing the problem they're solving.

Start simple: pick one workflow, automate it, measure results. Then expand.
```

**Why it's better:**
- 38 words, clear message
- Simple words throughout
- Specific: "one workflow"
- Actionable: "measure results"

## Content Types and Approaches

### Blog Post (500 words)

**Structure:**
1. **Opening** (3 sentences): State the point, why it matters, what you'll cover
2. **Main Body** (3-4 short sections): Each section = one sub-point with example
3. **Closing** (2 sentences): Summarize, provide next step

**Tone:** Confident, direct, helpful

### Twitter Thread (3-7 tweets)

**Structure:**
1. **Tweet 1:** Hook + promise
2. **Tweets 2-5:** Each tweet = one point
3. **Last tweet:** Conclusion or CTA

**Tone:** Conversational, punchy, specific

### LinkedIn Post (150 words)

**Structure:**
1. **Opening line:** Contrarian or surprising statement
2. **Body** (3-4 short paragraphs): Explain with example
3. **Closing:** Question to drive engagement

**Tone:** Professional but casual, insightful

## Quality Checklist

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Overcomplicating** - Using complex words to sound smart
❌ **Hedging** - "Perhaps," "might," "could possibly" weaken writing
❌ **Burying the lede** - Starting with context instead of the point
❌ **Jargon dumping** - "Leverage synergies to optimize outcomes"
❌ **Vague claims** - "Much faster" vs "3x faster"
❌ **Walls of text** - No paragraph breaks or white space
❌ **Being clever** - Wordplay that obscures meaning
❌ **Passive voice** - "It was discovered" vs "We discovered"

## Good vs Bad Examples

### Example 1: Product Announcement

**Bad:**
```
We're thrilled to announce the availability of our revolutionary new platform 
that leverages cutting-edge AI technology to facilitate seamless collaboration 
and drive unprecedented productivity gains for enterprise organizations.
```

**Good:**
```
Our new platform helps teams work together faster.

It uses AI to automate scheduling, summarize meetings, and track action items.

Early customers save 5 hours per week.
```

### Example 2: Technical Explanation

**Bad:**
```
The implementation utilizes a sophisticated neural network architecture 
that processes multimodal inputs through a series of transformer-based 
layers to generate contextually relevant outputs.
```

**Good:**
```
The model reads text and images, understands the context, and writes 
a response.

It works like autocomplete—but for entire paragraphs.
```

### Example 3: Social Media

**Bad:**
```
Excited to share some thoughts on the evolving nature of AI and its 
potential impact on knowledge work. There are numerous considerations 
that organizations must take into account...
```

**Good:**
```
AI won't replace your job.

But someone using AI will.

The skill isn't prompting. It's knowing what to build.
```
