# Organic Content for B2B SaaS

Templates and frameworks for building organic audience through podcasts, newsletters, and video content.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill should be used when:
- Building long-term brand awareness through consistent content
- Establishing thought leadership in a specific domain
- Creating a content flywheel for sustainable growth
- Reaching audiences without paid advertising spend
- Warming prospects before initiating outbound outreach

## Core Principles

**The Long Game:**
Organic takes 6-12 months to see results. It's an investment, not a quick win.

**The Pattern (Again):**
Value → Value → Value → Value → Value → Value → Ask

**Content Formula:**
90% education/entertainment, 10% promotion

**Consistency > Perfection:**
Weekly mediocre content beats monthly perfect content.

## How to Use This Skill

### Step 1: Select the Primary Content Channel

**Podcasts (Guest Appearances)** - Best for: Building authority, reaching established audiences
- Time: 1 hour per appearance
- Reach: 100-10,000 listeners per show
- ROI: High-quality backlinks, warm inbound

**Newsletter** - Best for: Owned audience, consistent touch-points
- Time: 2-4 hours per week
- Reach: Grows slowly (100 → 1,000 → 10,000)
- ROI: Highest LTV leads, direct relationship

**YouTube** - Best for: SEO, educational content
- Time: 4-8 hours per video
- Reach: Compounds over time
- ROI: Evergreen content, strong SEO

### Step 2: Reference the Appropriate Template

**Podcast Outreach** → `references/podcast-outreach.md`
- Guest invitation templates
- Topic pitch formats
- Follow-up sequences

**Newsletter Structure** → `references/newsletter-templates.md`
- Weekly format templates
- Content frameworks
- Sponsorship copy (when you get there)

**YouTube Scripts** → `references/youtube-scripts.md`
- Educational video structures
- Hook → Value → CTA format
- Thumbnail/title formulas

### Step 3: Execute Consistently

The core principle for organic growth: **Ship content every week, without exception**

Missing a single week disrupts momentum. Consistency compounds exponentially over time.

## Podcast Guest Strategy

### Finding Target Podcasts

**Tier 1: Perfect Fit** (10-20 shows)
- Audience = your ICP
- 500-5,000 downloads/episode
- Accept guests regularly

**Tier 2: Adjacent** (20-50 shows)
- Related but not exact audience
- 1,000-10,000 downloads/episode
- Harder to get on

**Tier 3: Aspirational** (5-10 shows)
- Dream shows
- 10,000+ downloads/episode
- Need warm intro

### Guest Pitch Template

**Subject:** Guest idea for [PODCAST_NAME]

**Body:**
```
Hi [HOST_NAME],

Love [PODCAST_NAME] - especially your recent episode with [GUEST_NAME] on [TOPIC].

I've been working on [YOUR_EXPERTISE] for [X YEARS] at [COMPANY]. Some unique angles I could cover:

1. [SPECIFIC_TOPIC_1] - [ONE_LINE_WHY_INTERESTING]
2. [SPECIFIC_TOPIC_2] - [ONE_LINE_WHY_INTERESTING]
3. [SPECIFIC_TOPIC_3] - [ONE_LINE_WHY_INTERESTING]

Here's a recent [PODCAST/ARTICLE/TALK] I did: [LINK]

Would any of these topics work for your audience?

[YOUR_NAME]
[TITLE]
[COMPANY] | [SOCIAL_PROOF]
```

**Expected success rate:** 10-20% with cold outreach, 50-70% with warm intro

### Topic Ideas That Get Accepted

✅ **Contrarian takes** - "Why [common advice] is wrong"
✅ **Behind-the-scenes** - "How we [achieved specific result]"
✅ **Tactical playbooks** - "The exact process we used to [outcome]"
✅ **Mistakes/failures** - "The $500k mistake that taught us [lesson]"
✅ **Data-driven insights** - "We analyzed 1000 [things] and found..."

❌ **Generic pitches** - "I can talk about marketing"
❌ **Product pitches** - "I want to share about our product"
❌ **No value** - "Would love to be on your show"

### Podcast Appearance Preparation

**Before:**
- Research host and show format
- Prepare 5-7 key stories
- Have 1-2 hot takes ready
- Prepare your CTA (what you want listeners to do)

**During:**
- Be conversational, not scripted
- Share specific examples with numbers
- Disagree when appropriate (it's interesting)
- Mention your company naturally, don't force it

**After:**
- Share episode 3-5 times across channels
- Repurpose into 5-10 pieces of content
- Stay in touch with host (future appearances)

## Newsletter Framework

### Weekly Structure Template

**Format: The [NUMBER] Things**

```
Subject: [PROVOCATIVE_QUESTION] (Issue #[NUMBER])

Hi [FIRST_NAME],

[ONE_LINE_HOOK_OR_INSIGHT]

---

1. [SPECIFIC_INSIGHT_OR_STORY]

[2-3 paragraphs expanding on it]

Key takeaway: [ONE_SENTENCE]

---

2. [ANOTHER_INSIGHT_OR_STORY]

[2-3 paragraphs]

Key takeaway: [ONE_SENTENCE]

---

3. [THIRD_INSIGHT_OR_STORY]

What I'm working on:
[ONE_PARAGRAPH_ABOUT_YOUR_WORK - this is where product mention goes]

See you next week,
[YOUR_NAME]

P.S. [INTERESTING_ASIDE_OR_CTA]
```

**Length:** 500-800 words
**Time to write:** 1-2 hours
**Send day:** Tuesday or Thursday (best open rates)

### Content Themes

## YouTube Strategy

### Video Script Structure

**Format: Educational/Tutorial** (8-12 minutes)

```
[0:00-0:15] HOOK
"In the next 10 minutes, I'll show you exactly how [OUTCOME]..."
Show the end result visually

[0:15-1:00] PROBLEM
"The problem with [current approach] is [specific issues]..."
Relate to viewer's pain

[1:00-1:30] PROMISE
"Here's what we'll cover:
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]"

[1:30-8:00] CONTENT
[Show, don't just tell - screen share, examples, walkthroughs]

[8:00-9:00] RECAP
"So we covered [quick summary]..."

[9:00-9:30] CTA
"If you want [related outcome], check out [link/tool/resource]"

[9:30-10:00] END SCREEN
Next video recommendation + subscribe button
```

### Video Topic Ideas

✅ **How-to tutorials** - "How to [achieve outcome]"
✅ **Tool comparisons** - "[Tool A] vs [Tool B]: Which is better?"
✅ **Teardowns** - "I analyzed [thing] and here's what I found"
✅ **Mistakes to avoid** - "Don't make these [number] mistakes"
✅ **Case studies** - "How [company] achieved [result]"

### Title & Thumbnail Formula

**Title Formula:**
- "How to [OUTCOME] (in [TIMEFRAME])"
- "[NUMBER] Ways to [ACHIEVE_RESULT]"
- "I [DID_THING] and Here's What Happened"
- "[TOOL/METHOD] vs [ALTERNATIVE]: Honest Comparison"

**Thumbnail Elements:**
- Your face (with expression)
- 3-5 words max of text
- Bright colors, high contrast
- Show the outcome/result

## Example Usage

**Scenario:** B2B SaaS founder building organic audience

**Month 1-2: Foundation**
- Start weekly newsletter
- Write 8 issues to build habit
- No promotion yet, just value
- Build to 50 subscribers (friends, network)

**Month 3-4: Podcast Tour**
- Identify 20 target podcasts
- Send 20 pitches over 2 weeks
- Book 3-5 appearances
- Each appearance → newsletter mention
- Grow to 200 subscribers

**Month 5-6: YouTube Launch**
- Create 8 videos (publish 1/week)
- Repurpose newsletter content
- Cross-promote newsletter in videos
- Grow to 500 subscribers

**Month 7-12: Consistency + Iteration**
- Newsletter every week (no exceptions)
- 1 podcast appearance per month
- 2 YouTube videos per month
- Grow to 2,000 subscribers

**Result:** 
- 2,000 newsletter subscribers (warm audience)
- 10+ podcast appearances (backlinks + authority)
- 15+ YouTube videos (SEO + evergreen content)
- Inbound leads starting to come in

## Critical Rules

1. **Ship weekly** - Prioritize consistency over perfection
2. **Value first** - Maintain 90% educational content, 10% promotional
3. **Repurpose** - Transform one core piece into 10 different formats
4. **Build in public** - Share the journey and process transparently
5. **Stay narrow** - Focus on one topic and explore it deeply

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Posting sporadically** - Inconsistency destroys momentum and audience trust
❌ **Too promotional** - Excessive promotion triggers immediate unsubscribes
❌ **No clear POV** - Lack of opinionated stance fails to build authority
❌ **Copying others** - Derivative content lacks the unique value audiences seek
❌ **Starting too broad** - Begin with a narrow niche before expanding
❌ **Quitting too early** - Organic growth requires 6-12 months to gain traction
