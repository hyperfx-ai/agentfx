# Cold Outbound for B2B SaaS

Proven templates for cold email and LinkedIn outreach that get responses and book meetings.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill should be used when:
- Building an outbound sales engine from scratch
- Reaching out to cold prospects via email or LinkedIn
- Following up on inactive leads with multi-touch sequences
- Testing new messaging approaches with A/B testing
- Personalizing outreach at scale while maintaining authenticity

## Core Principles

**The Pattern:**
Value → Value → Value → Value → Value → Value → Ask

**Cold Outreach Rules:**
- Keep it under 100 words
- One CTA per message
- Send from personal email (not marketing@)
- Personalize first line
- Make it about THEM, not you

## How to Use This Skill

### Step 1: Select the Appropriate Channel

**Email** (Best for: Initial outreach, detailed context)
- Can include more detail
- Easy to track opens/clicks
- Can automate sequences
- Response rate: 1-5% typical

**LinkedIn** (Best for: Executive outreach, relationship building)
- Higher visibility
- Better for senior titles
- Social proof via profile
- Response rate: 5-15% typical

### Step 2: Select Template Type

**Zero-Click (Awareness only)**
- No ask, just providing value
- Best for cold lists
- Builds awareness for retargeting

**Direct Ask (Meeting request)**
- Clear CTA for call/demo
- Best for warm leads
- Higher intent, lower volume

**Problem-First (Education)**
- Lead with pain point
- Position as peer
- Build credibility before asking

### Step 3: Personalize Each Message

Avoid sending generic templates. To maximize effectiveness, customize:
- **Line 1**: Make specific to the recipient or their company
- **Pain point**: Ensure relevance to their role and challenges
- **Social proof**: Reference similar companies to theirs
- **CTA**: Adjust appropriateness for their stage

### Step 4: Implement Multi-Touch Sequences

Implement a multi-touch sequence rather than single emails:
- Day 0: Initial email
- Day 3: Follow-up (different angle)
- Day 7: Breakup email
- Day 14: Final value drop

## Email Templates

### Template 1: The Zero-Click (Awareness Only)

**Subject:** Quick intro - [YOUR_PRODUCT]

**Body:**
```
Hi [THEIR_NAME],

Saw you're [THEIR_ROLE] at [THEIR_COMPANY].

We built [YOUR_PRODUCT] - it helps [SPECIFIC ROLE] with [SPECIFIC PROBLEM].

A few companies like [SIMILAR_COMPANY] have been using it to [SPECIFIC_RESULT].

Figured it might be relevant.

[YOUR_NAME]
```

**Best for:** Self-service products where awareness is the primary goal
**Expected response rate:** 0-2% (builds awareness for retargeting)

### Template 2: The Pattern Interrupt

**Subject:** [THEIR_COMPANY] + [YOUR_COMPANY]

**Body:**
```
[THEIR_NAME],

Two things:

1. [THEIR_COMPANY] is doing [IMPRESSIVE_THING] - respect
2. We help companies like yours [SPECIFIC_OUTCOME]

Worth 15 min?

[YOUR_NAME]
```

**Best for:** Targeting impressive companies with recent achievements
**Expected response rate:** 3-7%

### Template 3: The Problem-First

**Subject:** [PROBLEM] at [THEIR_COMPANY]?

**Body:**
```
[THEIR_NAME],

Quick question - is [THEIR_COMPANY] dealing with [SPECIFIC_PROBLEM]?

Most [THEIR_ROLE]s I talk to struggle with [PAIN_POINT_1] and [PAIN_POINT_2].

If that sounds familiar, I've got something that might help. [SOCIAL_PROOF_COMPANY] used it to [SPECIFIC_RESULT].

Worth a quick call to see if it fits?

[YOUR_NAME]
```

**Best for:** Situations where the pain point is deeply understood
**Expected response rate:** 5-10%

*See `references/cold-email-templates.md` for 12 more templates*

## LinkedIn Sequences

### 4-Touch LinkedIn Sequence

**Day 0: Connection Request**
```
Hi [NAME] - saw your work at [COMPANY]. Would love to connect!
```

**Day 3: Thank You + Value**
```
Thanks for connecting, [NAME]!

Saw [THEIR_COMPANY] just [RECENT_NEWS]. Congrats on that.

We help [SIMILAR_COMPANIES] with [SPECIFIC_PROBLEM]. If you ever want to chat about [TOPIC], happy to share what's worked for others.

[YOUR_NAME]
```

**Day 7: Specific Value**
```
[NAME] - thought of you when I saw this: [RELEVANT_ARTICLE/INSIGHT]

[ONE_SENTENCE_ABOUT_WHY_RELEVANT]

Also happy to share how [SIMILAR_COMPANY] solved [PROBLEM] if helpful.
```

**Day 14: Direct Ask**
```
[NAME] - been following [THEIR_COMPANY]'s growth.

We helped [COMPETITOR] do [SPECIFIC_THING].

Worth 15 min to see if we can do something similar for you?

[CALENDAR_LINK]
```

*See `references/linkedin-sequences.md` for complete sequences*

## Follow-Up Patterns

### The Bump (Day 3)

```
[NAME] - bumping this up in your inbox.

Worth a quick chat?

[ORIGINAL_EMAIL_QUOTED_BELOW]
```

### The Different Angle (Day 7)

```
[NAME] - one more thought.

Beyond [ORIGINAL_VALUE_PROP], we're also seeing companies use this for [DIFFERENT_USE_CASE].

[SIMILAR_COMPANY] saw [SPECIFIC_METRIC] in first month.

Interested in seeing how?

[YOUR_NAME]
```

### The Breakup (Day 10)

```
[NAME] - guessing this isn't a priority right now.

Should I close your file?

[YOUR_NAME]
```

**Note:** Breakup emails typically achieve the highest response rate (8-12%)

## Example Usage

**Scenario:** Selling analytics tool to VP Marketing at Series B SaaS companies

**Step 1: Build List**
- Filter: VP Marketing, Series B, SaaS, 50-200 employees
- Export 100 prospects

**Step 2: Personalize at Scale**
- Research each company (5 min/company max)
- Find: Recent funding, job postings, company news
- Note one specific detail per prospect

**Step 3: Send Sequence**

**Day 0 Email:**
```
Subject: Analytics at Acme Corp

Hi Sarah,

Saw Acme just raised Series B (congrats!). Usually means marketing is about to scale fast.

Most VPs I talk to hit a wall around 50-100 leads/day - reporting gets messy, attribution breaks, board decks take forever.

We built DataPulse for exactly this. Lattice went from 2 days/board deck to 30 minutes.

Worth 15 min to see if it fits?

John
```

**Day 3 Follow-Up:**
```
Sarah - bumping this.

Also just published this: [LINK TO RELEVANT CONTENT]

Thought you'd find the attribution section useful given Acme's growth stage.

John
```

**Day 7 Breakup:**
```
Sarah - should I close your file?

Guessing this isn't a priority right now.

John
```

**Result:** 6% booked meetings from 100-person list

## Personalization at Scale

**Time Budget: 5 minutes per prospect**

**Minute 1:** LinkedIn profile → Role, tenure, background
**Minute 2:** Company website → What they do, who they serve
**Minute 3:** Recent news → Funding, launches, hiring
**Minute 4:** Find connection → Shared experience, mutual connection
**Minute 5:** Write first line → Make it specific to them

**Formula:**
"Saw [COMPANY] just [RECENT_THING] - [ONE_SENTENCE_REACTION]"

## Critical Rules

1. **Under 100 words** - Keep messages concise to respect recipient time
2. **One CTA** - Avoid offering multiple options that create decision paralysis
3. **Personal email** - Send from personal addresses (john@company.com), not generic ones (sales@)
4. **No attachments** - Avoid attachments as they trigger spam filters
5. **Test subject lines** - Implement A/B testing for all messaging elements
6. **Track everything** - Monitor metrics to understand what drives results

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Too long** - Messages over 150 words see dramatically reduced response rates
❌ **About the sender** - Avoid phrases like "We're excited to..." or "We offer..."
❌ **Multiple asks** - Offering multiple options ("Call or email or...") creates confusion
❌ **Generic openers** - Phrases like "Hope this email finds you well" signal spam
❌ **No social proof** - Include at least one similar company name as reference
❌ **Weak CTA** - Replace passive CTAs ("Let me know if interested") with direct ones ("Worth 15 min?")
