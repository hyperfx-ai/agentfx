# Paid Ads for B2B SaaS

Ready-to-use templates and campaign structures for paid advertising across Facebook, Google Search, and LinkedIn.

## When to Use This Skill

- Creating new ad creative for testing
- Setting up campaign structures for optimal performance
- Testing new ad formats within platform constraints
- Writing ad copy designed to maximize conversion rates

## Core Principles

Before using any template, understand these principles:

**Average product + good marketing beats good product + average marketing**

**The Pattern:**
Value → Value → Value → Value → Value → Value → Ask
(Repeat this rhythm in all channels)

**Testing Framework:**
- Start small ($50-100/day)
- Test quickly (7-14 days per test)
- Double down on winners
- Don't touch what's working

## How to Use This Skill

### Step 1: Select the Appropriate Channel

**Facebook/Meta Ads** (Best for: Awareness, lead gen with large TAM)
- High volume, lower intent
- Visual-first platform
- UGC (User Generated Content) performs best
- Cost: $20-50 per lead typical

**Google Search Ads** (Best for: High-intent leads)
- People actively searching for solutions
- Text-based ads
- Phrase match keywords work best
- Cost: $50-200 per lead typical

**LinkedIn Ads** (Best for: Enterprise, specific job titles)
- Highest quality B2B targeting
- Most expensive platform
- Text ads for awareness, sponsored content for conversion
- Cost: $100-300 per lead typical

### Step 3: Customize Templates for Specific Products

Replace template placeholders with specific product details:

- `[OUTCOME]` → The result they get
- `[SPECIFIC ACTION]` → What your product does

### Step 4: Test and Scale

1. **Start with 3-5 variations**
2. **Run for 7-14 days** at minimum budget
3. **Identify winners** (lowest CPA, highest CTR)
4. **Kill losers** ruthlessly
5. **Scale winners** by 20-30% per week

## Facebook UGC Ad Scripts

**Hook (3s):**
"If you're spending more than 2 hours a week on [TASK], you're doing it wrong."

**Pain (7s):**

### Script 2: The Revelation

**Hook (3s):**
"I can't believe this existed the whole time and nobody told me."

**Solution (15s):**
"[PRODUCT] does all of this in literally 2 clicks. [SPECIFIC FEATURE] saves me 5 hours a week. If you're still doing [TASK] manually, stop. Link in bio."

**Best for:** Products that eliminate manual work entirely

### Script 3: Boss Hero

**Hook (3s):**
"My boss asked for [DELIVERABLE] by end of day. I had 6 hours."

**Pain (7s):**
"Normally this takes me 2 days. Pull data from 5 sources, build charts, write analysis. I was panicking."

**Solution (15s):**
"Used [PRODUCT]. Connected data sources. Asked it to make [DELIVERABLE]. Done in 30 minutes. Boss thought I had a secret team. You can try it free. Link in bio."

**Best for:** Products that address urgent deadline situations

## Example Usage

**Scenario:** B2B analytics SaaS launching first Facebook ads

**Step 1: Choose Script**
- Product saves time pulling reports
- Choose "Time Waster" script

**Step 2: Customize**
```
Hook: "If you're spending more than 2 hours a week on analytics reports, you're doing it wrong."

Pain: "I used to waste entire afternoons pulling data. Five different tools, building dashboards, trying to figure out what's actually working. It was killing me."

Solution: "Then I found DataPulse. Now it takes 10 minutes. It just pulls everything into one dashboard automatically. If you do analytics reporting, you need this. Link in bio."
```

**Step 3: Film**
- Selfie-style video
- 25 seconds total
- Authentic, not polished

**Step 4: Test**
- Create 3 variations with different hooks
- Budget: $50/day each
- Run for 10 days

**Step 5: Results**
- Script A: $45 CPA, 2.1% CTR ✓
- Script B: $89 CPA, 0.8% CTR ✗
- Script C: $52 CPA, 1.9% CTR ✓

**Step 6: Scale**
- Kill Script B
- Increase budget on A and C to $100/day each
- Create variations of winning scripts

## Critical Rules

1. **Test before scaling** - Avoid scaling unproven creative to prevent budget waste
2. **One variable at a time** - Isolate tests by changing hook OR pain OR solution, not multiple elements
3. **Give it time** - Allow minimum 7-14 days and 50-100 clicks before evaluating performance
4. **Kill losers fast** - Stop spending on underperforming creative immediately
5. **Scale winners slowly** - Increase budgets by 20-30% per week maximum to maintain efficiency

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Too feature-focused** - Lead with outcomes and benefits rather than feature lists
❌ **Weak hooks** - Ensure the first 3 seconds immediately stop the scroll
❌ **Multiple CTAs** - Provide one clear action per ad to avoid decision paralysis
❌ **No social proof** - Include numbers, logos, or testimonials to build credibility
❌ **Scaling too fast** - Rapid budget increases disrupt platform algorithms
❌ **Not testing enough** - Run minimum 3-5 creative variations per concept
